## Nasa Pictures Search

Part of my course at Manchester Codes I have been asked to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space. I was using the NASA API endpoint to complete the task.
`image search:
GET​​ ​​https://images-api.nasa.gov/search ​Params: ​​q`
