      As Part of my course at Manchester Codes I have been asked to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space.
      <br />
       I have used 
      <a
        class="aboutLink"
        href="https://api.nasa.gov/"
      >
        NASA Images and Video Library
      </a>
       for the search functionality.
    </p>
  </div>
</DocumentFragment>
